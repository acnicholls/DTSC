# DTSC
Database Table Script Creator

## What it does
DTSC connects to an XML file, MSSQL Database or MySQL Database and lists the tables as Menu Items.  The user then selects a table, and/or a script type, and an output flavour.  DTSC then creates a CREATE TABLE script and/or INSERT INTO scripts for each item, in the database flavour selected.
