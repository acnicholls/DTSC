# DTSC
Database Table Script Creator

## Purpose
This application was written to convert XML files into Database Table Creation scripts with Insert statements for data.  Later it was converted to do the same thing for tables in a SQL Server database.

## Development
Development is inactive, due to the many other tools on the market that can do similar work and have teams in active development.  It was a fun experiment back in 2005 to work on a few of my other projects at the time.
